JSL's Documentation
===============================

The JSL ('Jack Standard Library') is a set of tools developed by me (Jack Fraser) as a uniform, useful set of boilerplate code I found myself duplicating across numerous C++ projects. It is probably of no use to anyone else, but if you have found your way here, it is probably from one of the projects which utilised this library.
